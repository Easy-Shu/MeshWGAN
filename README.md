# MeshWGAN
As the metaverse rapidly develops, 3D facial age transformation will attract increasing attention, as it can bring many potential benefits to a wide variety of users, e.g., 3D aging figures creation, 3D facial data augmentation and attribute editing. Compared with 2D methods, 3D face aging is an underexplored problem. To fill this gap, we developed a new mesh-to-mesh Wasserstein GAN (MeshWGAN) with a multi-task gradient penalty to model a continuous bi-directional 3D facial geometric aging process.

## Acknowledgement
This code is inspired by 3D mesh network: [SpiralNet++](https://github.com/sw-gong/spiralnet_plus), and 2D face aging network [LATS](https://github.com/royorel/Lifespan_Age_Transformation_Synthesis). We also used these methods: 2D face aging network [SAM](https://github.com/yuval-alaluf/SAM), 3D facial details prediction [FaceScape](https://github.com/zhuhao-nju/facescape), 3D face reconstruction [Deep3DFace](https://github.com/sicxu/Deep3DFaceRecon_pytorch), 3D mesh registration [NICP](https://github.com/RhythmJnh/Non-rigid-ICP).
